# Vue Banking App

This app was a practice project for the CodeOp bootcamp. We used Vue to create this simple banking app. It calculates income, expenses, and balance. It also allows users to add items to the list of expenses or income, search the list of items, and filter the list of items based on whether something is income or an expense.

The app was largely built by the bootcamp instructor, so my goals with the project were:

1. Continue to familiarize myself with using Vue to build web apps.
2. Familiarize myself with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/) for styling.
3. Create an additional feature for the app on my own.

## Using Vue

This project was really good practice for using Vue to build a web app from scratch. The basic banking app clearly demonstrates how the different elements (template, script, styling) are connected and related within the app.

It's simple, but functional.

## Using Bootstrap

Until this point, I have been using naked CSS (vanilla), so I wanted to dig into using a tool like Bootstrap for styling. The basic styling was done by the instructor of the bootcamp, so I wanted to dig into it a little bit more and make some simple changes while familiarizing myself with the Bootstrap syntax and conventions.

The styling is simple, too. But functional. And I've really learned quite a lot about using a tool like Bootstrap for styling a web app can be quite useful.

## Creating Feature

I wanted to add a feature to the app on my own. While browsing Bootstrap default designs, I decided to implement a checkbox filter for the bank items. You can filter the items in the app by whether they are income (positive numbers) or expenses (negative numbers).

Initially, I wasn't quite sure how to do this, but with a little pseudocode guidance from the bootcamp TA (Thanks, Joy!), I was able to put together a computed value that filtered the items with the search bar and the checkboxes.

It took a little trial and error, but the method allows users to:

- Select income-only or expense-only to filter the items in the app
- Search filtered items using the search bar

# Reflection

This project was a nice way to reinforce what I have learned about using Vue to create web apps. I feel more confident in my ability to use Vue to create projects. I also feel somewhat confident that I could use Bootstrap to work with styling for projects in the future.

Some moderate debugging was required in this project, so I feel more confident my ability to work through coding challenges and find solutions to problems I'm facing while coding.

Looking ahead, I hope to continue to build on the things I've learned with this project. Specifically, I hope to continue to use CSS libraries for styling future projects.
